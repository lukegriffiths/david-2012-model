# Interactive plot for David et al. (2012) model

Calculates stress-strain curve during the uniaxial compression of a microcracked material. The strain is calculated as a function of the axial stress, crack density, crack aspect ratio, friction coefficient, and the intact Young's modulus of the material.

This model accounts for hysteresis during loading/unloading stress cycling, due to the sliding and locking of microcracks when stress is applied and released.

## Requirements
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy

## Example
Run plotDavidModel to load the data in ./data/data_template.xlsx

Fit the modelled curve (red line) to the data (blue line), changing the model parameters by clicking within the corresponding bars, or by dragging the sliders.

Standard deviation or error between the modelled stress-strain curve and the data is printed to the terminal.
